# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project - README
## Project Overview
In this project, I applied machine learning concepts of reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a real-world problem: developing an intelligent agent for navigating a maze. I implemented a pirate agent using Q-learning which is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal was for the pirate to traverse the maze and successfully reach the treasure while avoiding obstacles and learning the best optimal path through trial and error.

## Code Overview
For this project, I was provided with the framework of the environment, including the maze setup and the structure for initializing the Q-learning model. The code I created involved the actual implementation of the Q-learning algorithm, as well as the logic for updating the Q-table based on the agent's experiences in the environment. I also wrote the logic for training the model over multiple episodes, tuning hyperparameters, and testing the agent's performance in different configurations of the maze. 

The main functions I implemented include:

Q-learning Algorithm: This portion of the code handles the agent's exploration and exploitation balance, the update of the Q-table after each action, and the discounting of future rewards.
Training the Agent: I wrote the training loop that iteratively updated the agentâ€™s behavior by running the agent through the maze for thousands of episodes.
Performance Metrics: The win count and the loss over time were recorded to monitor the agent's improvement, with the goal of increasing the win rate as the agent learned to navigate the maze more efficiently.

## Reflection on Learning and Computer Science
This project allowed me to gain a deeper insight into the field of machine learning with reinforcement learning, which is a significant aspect of modern artificial intelligence. Computer scientists are tasked with developing algorithms and systems that solve complex problems in an efficient and ethical manner. This work matters because, in a world increasingly driven by data and automation, intelligent systems have the potential to greatly enhance decision-making processes, reduce human error, and create new opportunities across various industries.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I first analyze the problem to break it down into manageable components. Such as identifying the state space and reward structures for this maze problem. Then, I plan and plot out each parameter that I want to implement. An example is how I applied existing theories and algorithms, like Q-learning to the pirate intelligent maze project. I also implemented test cases and evaluation methods so that the solution performs well under different conditions.

## Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I am now understanding my ethical responsibilities toward both end users and organizations. In reinforcement learning projects like this one, I feel it is essential to validate that the models are transparent, fair, and accountable. When deployed in real-world applications, agents must behave predictably and avoid unintended harmful consequences. The data used for training must be handled responsibly, and privacy should be maintained to safeguard the interests of all users, internal and external.
